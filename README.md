# Wellness Wave

**Wellness Wave** is a visually captivating web project designed to promote mindfulness and tranquility through a combination of immersive visuals, seamless animations, and an overall smooth user experience. The project incorporates modern web development tools and technologies, focusing on clean design and responsive layouts that bring together art and technology for a peaceful and engaging web experience.

## Features

- **Locomotive Scroll Integration**: Implemented to provide users with smooth scrolling animations, adding a layer of sophistication to the page transitions. Locomotive Scroll allows for effortless navigation, enhancing the overall experience.
  
- **GSAP Animations**: Leveraging the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), the project offers fluid animations for both text and graphical elements. These animations make interactions lively, keeping the user engaged while exploring various parts of the site.

- **Video Backgrounds**: The project features autoplaying videos as the background for several sections, reinforcing a theme of calmness and serenity. These videos are optimized for web performance and play an essential role in setting the project's tranquil tone.

- **Responsive Design**: The entire project is built with responsive design principles in mind. The layout adjusts seamlessly across devices, ensuring that the website looks and functions perfectly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens.

- **Custom Fonts**: A combination of Google Fonts, including **Plus Jakarta Sans**, and the **Canopee** font is used throughout the project. These fonts are carefully chosen to create a unique design language that aligns with the wellness theme, making the typography both readable and aesthetically pleasing.
